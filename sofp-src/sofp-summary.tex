Compute the smallest integer expressible as a sum of two cubed integers
in more than one way.

Read a text file, split it by spaces into words, and print the word
counts, sorted by decreasing count.

FPIS exercise 2.2: Check whether a sequence \lstinline!Seq[A]! is
sorted according to a given ordering function of type \lstinline!(A, A) => Boolean!.

FPIS exercise 3.24: Implement a function \lstinline!hasSubsequence!
that checks whether a \lstinline!List! contains another \lstinline!List!
as a subsequence. For instance, \lstinline!List(1,2,3,4)! would have
\lstinline!List(1,2)!, \lstinline!List(2,3)!, and \lstinline!List(4)!
as subsequences, among others. (Dynamic programming?)

(Bird, de Moor page 20) Derive the following identity between functions
$F^{A}\rightarrow F^{A}$, for any filterable functor $F$ and any
predicate $p^{:A\rightarrow\bbnum 2}$: 
\[
\text{filt}_{F}(p)=(\Delta\bef\text{id}\boxtimes p)^{\uparrow F}\bef\text{filt}_{F}(\nabla_{2})\bef\nabla_{1}^{\uparrow F}\quad.
\]
